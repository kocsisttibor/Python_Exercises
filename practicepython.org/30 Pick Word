Practice Python 30 - Pick Word
http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2016/09/24/30-pick-word.html

In this exercise, the task is to write a function that picks a random word from a list of words from the SOWPODS dictionary. Download this file and save it in the same directory as your Python code. This file is Peter Norvig’s compilation of the dictionary of words used in professional Scrabble tournaments. Each line in the file contains a single word.

Hint: use the Python random library for picking a random word.
