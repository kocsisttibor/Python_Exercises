Practice Python 17 - Decode A Web Page
http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/06/06/17-decode-a-web-page.html

Use the BeautifulSoup and requests Python packages to print out a list of all the article titles on the New York Times homepage.

To install requests and BeautifulSoup this worked for me:
go to idle and type "for p in sys.path:" then click enter and type "print (p)" and click enter, my path is "C:\Users\c\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32\Scripts". Go to cmd and type "cd "C:\pathway"" and click enter.

After this, you should be able to use pip3.6 by going "pip3.6 install -package name-".

import requests

base_url = 'http://www.index.hu'
r = requests.get(base_url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(r.text)
 
for story_heading in soup.find_all(class_="story-heading"): 
    if story_heading.a: 
        print(story_heading.a.text.replace("\n", " ").strip())
    else: 
        print(story_heading.contents[0].strip())
