http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/04/25/12-list-ends.html

Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]) and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list. For practice, write this code inside a function.
"""
a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]

def first_and_last(m):
  b = [m[0], m[-1]]
  print(b)
  
first_and_last(a)
