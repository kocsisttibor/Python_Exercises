Practice Python 16 - Password Generator
http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/05/28/16-password-generator.html

Write a password generator in Python. Be creative with how you generate passwords - strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password. Include your run-time code in a main method.

Extra:

Ask the user how strong they want their password to be. For weak passwords, pick a word or two from a list.

import random

user_input = int(input("How many characters long password do you need?"))

characters = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxzyABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789.:,?;<>#&@"

def password(a):
  output = []
  i = 1
  while i <= a:
    b = random.choice(characters)         
    output.append(b)
    i += 1
  print("Your password: " + "".join(output))

password(user_input)
