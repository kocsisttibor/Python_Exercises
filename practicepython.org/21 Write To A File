Practice Python 21 - Write To A File
http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/11/30/21-write-to-a-file.html

Take the code from the How To Decode A Website exercise (if you didn’t do it or just want to play with some different code, use the code from the solution), and instead of printing the results to a screen, write the results to a txt file. In your code, just make up a name for the file you are saving to.

Extras:

Ask the user to specify the name of the output file that will be saved.
