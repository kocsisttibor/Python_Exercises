Practice Python 11 - Check Primality Functions
http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/04/16/11-check-primality-functions.html

Ask the user for a number and determine whether the number is prime or not. (For those who have forgotten, a prime number is a number that has no divisors.). You can (and should!) use your answer to Exercise 4 to help you. Take this opportunity to practice using functions, described below.

  i = a - 1
  count = 0
  
  while i > 1:
    if a % i == 0:
      count += 1
